# Cosmic Structure Formation with Gadget-4 code

This repository contains the code developed for an assignment for the subject 'Simulaciones Num√©ricas' from the MsC in Astrophysics at Universidad de La Laguna. It includes code for generation of initial conditions and post-processing of Gadget-4 simulation output.

## Renders from simulation runs

The following animations were created with Blender with Python Scripting:
